# SubstringHashSwift

Program to find an 8-letter substring within a string that produces a given hash solution. Written in Swift and submitted as part of my job application for the iOS Developer position at Trello.

Read the problem description in the .png file first, before looking at my code, if you want to give it a shot before you see the solution.

The Trello Playground is the solution without the UI, and the TrelloJobApplication is the solution as an iOS app.

I didn’t get the job, but I got through the HR screen and the 1st round of technical interviews because of this program, so I must have done something right. :)
